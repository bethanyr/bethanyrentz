I've recently started a Ruby on Rails boot camp through [Code Fellows](http://codefellows.org) in Seattle. I am excited to learn about building web applications using this technology. Previously my web experience has been using Microsoft web technologies (asp.net & SQL server).

I am posting my code samples out to [git hub](https://github.com/bethanyr) - if you want to see what I'm working on and will start writing blog posts about different development related topics - so stay tuned...
