I have decided to change my blogging platform. I was using Blogger - since it was pretty easy to get up and running and could use a GUI for formatting the posts. But now I've learned more about using markdown and git and AWS - I decided to move my blog to using Jekyll (a ruby app) and use AWS for the hosting.
